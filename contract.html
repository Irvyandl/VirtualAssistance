    <h1>Service Agreement</h1>

    <p><strong>Client Name:</strong> [Client Full Name]<br>
    <strong>Business Name (if applicable):</strong> [Client Business Name]<br>
    <strong>Contact Email:</strong> [Client Email Address]</p>

    <p><strong>Service Provider:</strong> Irvin Prado<br>
    <strong>Business Field:</strong> Virtual Assistance & BI Services<br>
    <strong>Email:</strong> irvyandl18@gmail.com</p>

    <h2>1. Scope of Services</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Task 1: [Insert Task]</li>
      <li>Task 2: [Insert Task]</li>
      <li>Task 3: [Insert Task]</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Services will be delivered remotely through digital tools. Provider obligations are defined by the specific service plan selected and paid for. The plan also includes availability for additional one-time projects related to the plan’s scope.</p>

    <h2>2. Ownership of Work</h2>
    <p>All materials created during the course of the service, including documents, presentations, and dashboards, become the client’s intellectual property upon full payment.</p>

    <h2>3. Payment Policy</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Clients must complete payment via Escrow.com within 2 calendar days after receiving the first invoice following the trial phase. If payment is not received, services will be canceled. <em>This clause applies only to the first invoice.</em></li>
      <li>Each monthly cycle officially begins on the date the invoice is issued by the provider. This invoice date, not the agreement signature date, will serve as the service start date.</li>
      <li>If payment is not received by Day 30 of the billing cycle, a 10% late fee will be added for each day of delay. All services, tasks, and deliverables will be suspended until payment is received in full, including penalties.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Fee Adjustments</h2>
    <p>Service fees may be adjusted at the provider’s discretion due to upgrades, added tools, or operational cost changes. Clients will be notified at least 10 days before the new rate takes effect at the end of the current cycle.</p>

    <h2>5. One-Time Project Policies</h2>
    <p>Projects must be requested at least 48 hours before the desired delivery date. A 50% deposit is due upon approval, with the remaining 50% due upon delivery. Only deliverables that are part of the purchased plan ([Insert Plan Name]) will be fulfilled. External requests require a new agreement.</p>

    <h2>6. Terms of Termination</h2>
    <p>Either party may terminate the agreement with 10 days’ written notice. Notice must be given by Day 20 of a billing cycle to avoid further charges. Once terminated, the agreement is no longer valid.</p>

    <h2>7. Communication Policy</h2>
    <p>Task and project instructions must be provided in writing (email, Slack, WhatsApp). The provider will respond with a recap. If no corrections are submitted within 30 minutes, the task or project will proceed based on the confirmed scope.</p>

    <h2>8. Project Requests</h2>
    <p>All project tasks and add-ons must fall within the scope of the client's selected service plan ([Insert Plan Name]).</p>

    <h2>9. Force Majeure</h2>
    <p>In the event of natural disasters or political emergencies affecting the provider’s location, services may be paused. A minimum of 12 hours' notice and verifiable documentation (e.g., weather alerts or news reports) will be provided.</p>

    <h2>10. Health & Emergency Leave</h2>
    <p>In the case of illness or medical emergencies, a 48-hour notice will be given. The provider will include an estimate of how many hours or days of service may be impacted whenever possible.</p>

    <h2>11. Confidentiality</h2>
    <p>All client information will remain strictly confidential during and after the agreement term. NDAs may be signed upon request.</p>

    <h2>12. Legal Jurisdiction</h2>
    <p>This agreement will be governed by a jurisdiction mutually agreed upon by both parties before contract execution.</p>

    <h2>13. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>The provider shall not be liable for errors, delays, or disruptions caused by third-party platforms, collaborators, or persons. The provider is only responsible for performance directly tied to their tasks. Errors stemming from client-provided data or incomplete instructions are not covered. One-time projects affected by such errors will require full repayment for redelivery. In general service cycles, no extra hours or refunds apply under these conditions.</p>
