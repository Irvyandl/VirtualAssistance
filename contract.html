    <h1>Service Agreement</h1>

    <p><strong>Client Name:</strong> [Client Full Name]<br>
    <strong>Business Name (if applicable):</strong> [Client Business Name]<br>
    <strong>Contact Email:</strong> [Client Email Address]</p>

    <p><strong>Service Provider:</strong> Irvin Prado<br>
    <strong>Business Field:</strong> Virtual Assistance & BI Services<br>
    <strong>Email:</strong> irvyandl18@gmail.com</p>

    <h2>0. Purpose of Agreement</h2>
    <p>This agreement outlines the terms of a professional collaboration built on trust, timely delivery, and clear communication between both parties.</p>

    <h2>1. Scope of Services</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Task 1: [Insert Task]</li>
      <li>Task 2: [Insert Task]</li>
      <li>Task 3: [Insert Task]</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Services will be delivered remotely through digital tools. Provider obligations are determined by the specific service plan selected and paid for. Availability for on-demand project execution is included based on the scope of the plan.</p>

    <h2>2. Ownership of Work</h2>
    <p>All materials created during the course of the service, including documents, presentations, and dashboards, are the intellectual property of the client upon full payment.</p>

    <h2>3. Payment Policy</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Clients must complete payment via Escrow.com within 2 calendar days of receiving the invoice following the trial phase. Failure to do so will result in cancellation of the service. *This clause only applies to the first invoice issued; subsequent invoices are not subject to this trial window.*</li>
      <li>The collaboration and the monthly cycle officially begin on the date the invoice is issued by the provider, not the agreement signature date.</li>
      <li>If payment is late, a notice will be sent by message on Day 1 of delay. From Day 3, a 10% late fee will apply per day. Work, task delivery, and project access will be suspended until payment is completed with all applicable charges.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Fee Adjustments</h2>
    <p>Service rates may be updated by the provider in response to inflation or improvements in service quality, tools, or value added. Any rate change will be notified at least 10 days before the new billing cycle begins.</p>

    <h2>5. One-Time Projects Policies</h2>
    <p>One-time projects must be requested atleast 48 hours before the desired delivery date. A 50% advance is required upon approval, and the remaining 50% is payable upon delivery. Only deliverables within the paid plan ([Insert Plan Name]) will be considered. External requests require a separate agreement.</p>

    <h2>6. Terms of Termination</h2>
    <p>Either party may end this agreement with 10 days prior written notice. Notice must be provided by Day 20 of a monthly cycle to avoid extended billing obligations. Once a service is canceled, the agreement is no longer in force.</p>

    <h2>7. Communication Policy</h2>
    <p>Task and project requests must be submitted in writing (email, Slack, WhatsApp). The provider will reply with a scope recap and request a "reply to confirm." If no reply is received within 30 minutes, the task will be executed based on the information shared in the recap message.</p>

    <h2>8. Project Requests</h2>
    <p>Project work and additional deliverables are selected by the client based on the features available in their chosen plan ([Insert Plan Name]).</p>

    <h2>9. Force Majeure</h2>
    <p>In the case of natural disasters or political unrest in the providerâ€™s location, work may be paused with at least 12 hours' notice and proof (e.g., weather alert or official report).</p>

    <h2>10. Health & Emergency Leave</h2>
    <p>If a personal health issue arises, the provider will give a 48-hour notice and outline the expected downtime, including an estimated number of hours or days affected whenever possible.</p>

    <h2>11. Confidentiality</h2>
    <p>Client information will remain confidential throughout and after the agreement. NDAs may be signed upon request.</p>

    <h2>12. Legal Jurisdiction</h2>
    <p>To be defined mutually by both parties before the agreement is finalized.</p>

    <h2>13. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>The provider shall not be held liable for any damage, delays, or disruptions caused by third-party tools, platforms, collaborators, or persons. The provider is only responsible for performance directly related to their own tasks as agreed in the scope of services. Errors resulting from misinformation or incomplete instructions will not be subject to refunds or extra hours. Redelivery for one-time projects must be paid anew. No hour bonuses or refunds apply to general service cycles when such errors occur.</p>

    <h2>14. Agreement Review & Renewal</h2>
    <p>This agreement may be reviewed and adjusted at any time upon request by either party. Unless changes are requested, no formal renewal is required. The agreement remains valid and in force as long as active payments are being made.</p>
