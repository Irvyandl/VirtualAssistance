    <h1>Service Agreement</h1>

    <p><strong>Client Name:</strong> [Client Full Name]<br>
    <strong>Business Name (if applicable):</strong> [Client Business Name]<br>
    <strong>Contact Email:</strong> [Client Email Address]</p>

    <p><strong>Service Provider:</strong> Irvin Prado<br>
    <strong>Business Field:</strong> Virtual Assistance & BI Services<br>
    <strong>Email:</strong> irvyandl18@gmail.com</p>

    <h2>0. Purpose of Agreement</h2>
    <p>This agreement outlines the terms of a professional collaboration built on trust, timely delivery, and clear communication between both parties.</p>

    <h2>1. Scope of Services</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Task 1: [Insert Task]</li>
      <li>Task 2: [Insert Task]</li>
      <li>Task 3: [Insert Task]</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Services will be delivered remotely using digital tools. Provider responsibilities are defined by the selected plan. Task and project tracking, priority, and execution will be organized using Google Keep Notes with labels and color codes as agreed upon during onboarding.</p>

    <h2>2. Ownership of Work</h2>
    <p>All work materials, including documents, visuals, and data outputs, are transferred to the client once full payment is received for the associated billing cycle.</p>

    <h2>3. Payment Policy</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Payment must be made via HelloBonsai within 2 calendar days of the first invoice after trial phase. Non-payment will result in service cancellation.</li>
      <li>The collaboration starts on the invoice date (not the agreement signature date).</li>
      <li>If payment is late: Day 1 = written notice, Day 3 = 10% daily late fee begins, and work is suspended until all dues are cleared.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Fee Adjustments</h2>
    <p>Service pricing may be updated to reflect inflation, improvements, or upgraded tools/services. Notice of change will be provided at least 10 days prior to renewal.</p>

    <h2>5. One-Time Projects Policies</h2>
    <p>Projects must be requested at least 48 hours in advance and require 50% upfront and 50% upon delivery. Projects must align with the paid plan ([Insert Plan Name]).</p>

    <h2>6. Terms of Termination</h2>
    <p>Either party can terminate with 10 days’ written notice. Cancellation before Day 20 of the billing cycle avoids further charges. Agreement ends once service is terminated.</p>

    <h2>7. Communication & Task Confirmation</h2>
    <p>All task instructions must be submitted in writing. The provider sends a scope recap with a "reply to confirm" request. If no reply is received in 30 minutes, the task proceeds per the recap. Communication and recordkeeping are managed using Google Keep.</p>

    <h2>8. Task Tracking & SOP</h2>
    <p>Tasks are delegated and tracked in Google Keep using labeled notes. Delegation includes task description, target completion, priority color, and delegation timestamp. Weekly resets archive completed items. Feedback can be submitted anytime via a labeled note, and response is expected upon notification.</p>

    <h2>9. Force Majeure</h2>
    <p>Delays caused by external factors (disasters, political events, etc.) are valid with 12-hour notice and evidence.</p>

    <h2>10. Health & Emergency Leave</h2>
    <p>In case of illness or personal emergency, the provider will notify the client with a 48-hour estimate of downtime and recovery expectations.</p>

    <h2>11. Confidentiality</h2>
    <p>All client data is treated confidentially and will not be disclosed. NDAs are welcomed when applicable.</p>

    <h2>12. Legal Jurisdiction</h2>
    <p>Jurisdiction will be mutually agreed upon prior to contract finalization.</p>

    <h2>13. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>The provider is not liable for third-party errors or damages. Responsibility is limited to the provider’s direct deliverables. Mistakes from inaccurate client information do not qualify for refunds or compensatory hours.</p>

    <h2>14. Agreement Review & Renewal</h2>
    <p>The agreement may be revised if requested by either party. No formal renewal is needed unless revisions are made. This contract remains valid while payments continue on time.</p>
