    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

    <h3>What services do you offer as a Virtual Assistant?</h3>
    <p>I provide structured virtual assistance and data services, including inbox/calendar management, CRM updates, reporting, dashboards (Excel/Power BI), and branded slide design (PowerPoint/Canva). Task management is supported through Google Keep for transparent, easy-to-follow collaboration.</p>

    <h3>How do your pricing and collaboration work?</h3>
    <p>Everything is based on the client’s specific needs. Once you complete the <a href="https://irvyandl.github.io/VirtualAssistance/contact.html" target="_blank">contact page</a> form, I review your goals, workload, and priorities. Then, I build a custom monthly plan — including hours, deliverables, and price — that fits your workflow and budget. No generic packages. Every collaboration is unique and designed around you. The scope and SOP are created collaboratively based on what works best for your tools and routines.</p>

    <h3>How do I know you're reliable and organized?</h3>
    <p>I use structured task tracking through Google Keep with color-coded priorities and labels, along with formal SOP workflows. You’ll always be able to check what's pending, submitted, and completed in real-time, supported by regular check-ins and weekly summaries.</p>

    <h3>Do you handle confidential data securely?</h3>
    <p>Yes. I use encrypted cloud services (Google Drive, OneDrive), and strong password policies. NDAs are welcome, and I treat sensitive business data with the confidentiality it deserves.</p>

    <h3>How do payments work?</h3>
    <p>I use <strong>HelloBonsai.com</strong> to ensure mutual protection. Once we agree on the terms, you'll receive a private invoice link. Payments are due before each cycle starts. A 10% daily late fee applies, and after 3 days, all services will be suspended until the payment is cleared. Day 1 includes a written reminder.</p>

    <h3>What happens if I miss a payment?</h3>
    <p>You will receive a payment reminder on Day 1. A 10% daily late fee begins immediately. If payment is still not received by Day 3, tasks and deliveries are paused. All work resumes once the full balance (including any penalties) is cleared.</p>

    <h3>What if I want to request a one-time project?</h3>
    <p>You can request additional one-time projects related to your current plan at any time. These must be submitted at least 48 hours in advance and require 50% payment upfront. The remaining 50% is due on delivery.</p>

    <h3>Do I need to renew my contract monthly?</h3>
    <p>No renewal is required unless changes are needed. The agreement remains valid as long as monthly payments are made. Either party can request revisions at any time if circumstances evolve.</p>

    <h3>How do you confirm the scope of my tasks?</h3>
    <p>All instructions must be submitted in writing (email, Slack, WhatsApp). I’ll send a recap to confirm the scope. If no response is received within 30 minutes, the task will proceed based on that recap as confirmation. This ensures clarity for both sides.</p>

    <h3>How is feedback managed?</h3>
    <p>You can leave feedback using a Google Keep note labeled “Feedback” following a simple format (reference, comment, and date). You can prioritize it visually with colors — red/peach for urgent, yellow for non-urgent — and notify me when it’s submitted.</p>

    <h3>Will we sign a contract?</h3>
    <p>Yes. You will receive a personalized agreement based on the selected plan. It outlines hours, deliverables, deadlines, payment, task policy, emergency clauses, and more.</p>

    <h3>What if there's an emergency or unexpected situation?</h3>
    <p>If I face medical leave or a local emergency (weather, internet, etc.), you'll receive notice at least 48 hours in advance, or 12 hours for urgent events. Work pauses only in unavoidable scenarios and resumes as soon as possible.</p>

    <h3>How do we get started?</h3>
    <p>Simply fill out my short onboarding form on the <a href="https://irvyandl.github.io/VirtualAssistance/contact.html" target="_blank">contact page</a>. I’ll use it to tailor your plan and initiate the contract and invoice. Once confirmed, work begins.</p>
